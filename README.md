## Description

This project introduces a novel approach to food assessment and analysis. By utilizing a specialized OnePlate, it employs pixel-counting technology to accurately measure food portions, facilitating precise calculations of calories and nutrients. Additionally, the integration of YOLOv5 enhances food recognition, allowing for reliable ingredient identification and calorie estimation. This technology-driven solution aims to provide users with comprehensive and accurate insights into their meals.

## Features

1. **YOLOv5 Function**
   - Perform object detection on a plate to determine the amount of food.
   - Identify the type of food on the plate through food type discrimination.

2. **U-Net Function**
   - Segment each type of food using image segmentation techniques.
   - Remove the background to isolate the food area.
   - Calculate the area of each segmented food type at the pixel level.

3. **Calculation Function**
   - Calculate nutritional information for the segmented food items:
     - Amount of food
     - Calories
     - Protein
     - Fat
     - Dietary fiber
     - Cholesterol
     - Sodium
